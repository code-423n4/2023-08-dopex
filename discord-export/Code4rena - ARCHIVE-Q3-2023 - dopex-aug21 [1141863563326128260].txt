I felt this might be helpful, forge build will be unable to resolve some imports due to wrong capitalization.
 I have corrected them below:

In Setup.t.sol:
``
import { ReLPContract } from "../../contracts/reLP/ReLPContract.sol";
// import { ReLPContract } from "../../contracts/relp/ReLPContract.sol";
``

In Periphery.t.sol:
``
// import { UniV2LiquidityAMO } from "../../contracts/amo/UniV2LiquidityAMO.sol";

import { UniV2LiquidityAMO } from "../../contracts/amo/UniV2LiquidityAmo.sol";


// import { UniV3LiquidityAMO } from "../../contracts/amo/UniV3LiquidityAMO.sol";

import { UniV3LiquidityAMO } from "../../contracts/amo/UniV3LiquidityAmo.sol";
``

In MockRdpxEthPriceOracle.sol
``
import { IUniswapV2Pair } from "../uniswap_V2/IUniswapV2Pair.sol";
// import { IUniswapV2Pair } from "../uniswap_v2/IUniswapV2Pair.sol";
``

Kinda unrelated question. Does it matter the time when you submit vulnerability findings? Or is it advised to wait until the end to send a complete report of all findings? Didnt find much on this in the documentation. Just that wardens with the same findings share the bounty.


[08/22/2023 19:34] parsely.
That is a good question, I am not 100% sure, but I am of the opinion (PLEASE NOTE THIS IS JUST A PERSONAL OPINION) that is does not really matter when I submit my findings, I personally hold on to them , in case I find a way to either chain them or perhaps as I delve into the code more I invalidate them so I dont need to submit them.

afaik, it does not matter when you submit your findings as long as they're valid, I'd personally also prefer @parsely 's method, just to be sure and validate the findings one more time before submitting them.

there is very less info about that in readme as well as on the website


[08/23/2023 11:45] 0xnevi
With their notion page, i crafted the flow in roughly 30 minutes. More than enough information imo.


[08/23/2023 11:46] saint6704
before you edited this comment I literally felt how can you craft the flow with just a few lines

I felt dumb for a min


[08/23/2023 11:47] 0xnevi
Ya correction haha tho i took about 5 hours to understand the protocol fully so take ur time


[08/23/2023 11:47] 0xnevi
Dont rush slow and steady


[08/23/2023 11:48] saint6704
I understand what the protocol is all about and what it is doing but I am digging up on the flow rn


[08/23/2023 11:48] saint6704
I got much time for this


[08/23/2023 11:48] 0xnevi
My advice is like any other protocol, start from the core contract and branch out


[08/23/2023 11:49] saint6704
Seems a good advice ser 
I'll do that

@psytama what are typical amounts for `reLPFactor` in `ReLPContract.sol` ?

.09 is one example for the reLP amount but it will depend on the amount of liquidity in the pool and the liquidity owned by the AMO.

[08/24/2023 09:06] lourenslinde
For markdown it's usually `![text](url)` (the same as a link but with an `!` in front of it), but I'm not 100% sure that it's supported in code4rena submissions.  

If you're trying to add a code block you can do that with three ` symbols to start the block and again to end the block. ```This gives this format```


[08/24/2023 09:32] chiadika99
can the url be external ?

```
Call option writers receive an upfront premium but pay call option buyers if the price of an asset increases beyond the strike price. If the difference in price exceeds the premiums earned, writers may incur a loss.

how the writers may incure a loss ?

is that mean when someone write(sell or become writer)  a call option it mean he expect the price to become lower than the ` premium`?
```
Writing call options is useful for liquidity providers who expect the price of an asset to decrease or remain stable. It is not a risk-free strategy since losses are technically uncapped.

5/ The writer will receive a premium from buyer for the ability to purchase the contract. The writer will be at risk and can incur financial loss if the settlement price of the asset is lower than their written strike price at expiration and the buyer exercises the right to buy.

@psytama The protocol will always be the writer of an option and user the Buyer ? And the funding payments to PerpetualAtlanticVault aims to pay users that exercises the options, which expires in each epoch (1 week) ?


[08/26/2023 22:30] 0xsl1
i may be wrong,  but when the bondId != 0, it means  that we are dealing with decayingbond that is already minted, but when bondid is 0, it mints a normal bond

so when bondId is 0 it means the user has to transfer rdpx but if it has a non 0 value then they want to use the id of decaying bondable rdpx NFT the only way a user receives this is if they face a loss using one of our other products then as a rebate a decaying bondable rdpx bond is minted for the user with a expiry after which it is no longer valid and a amount based on the loss.

[08/27/2023 07:19] 0xpsytama
the delegate id is the case where a user wants to bond but does not have weth to use so they can use weth from one or more of the delegates who delegated their weth to be used for bonding for a fee. this is only possible with bondWithDelegate and a user can still use a decayingRdpxBond while bonding with a delegate by passing a ID or use 0 to use their own rdpx balance.

The purpose of the VaultLP is that Users can deposit to give liquidity to protocol and in exchange they can redeem rewards or the idea is staking options premiums while the epoch doesnt end ?

they would be able to collect funding which is paid by the treasury for all the active options and the initial premium a user pays while bonding.

@psytama In AtlanticVault, latestFundingPaymentPointer value is supposed to be the value of the next epoch  ? (Last Time the funding was paid = epoch 5, so latestFundingPaymentPointer  = 6).

Do we have any approximations for what the `premium` on a bond should be
In the tests it is 0.05 ETH for a bond of 0.7 ETH and 25 RDPX ( counted for 10% discount ) with real prices and bond quantity of 1e18
@psytama  Can this be a correct approximation or at least to be close to the real value of a `premium` as it's 1/14 of it?


[08/28/2023 14:17] 0x3b

The buyer will only be the core contract and the core will pay funding to the writers in weth at the beginning of every epoch

so where does dpx come into play as mentioned here 
` The liquidity for this will be provided via the open market and will be incentivized via DPX`

i think someone asked what is the receipt token, the receiptToken refers to the LP token on curve pool that the users get by bonding rdpx and eth on the rdpxV2 contract.
bond rdpx and eth on rdpxV2 --> get receiptToken on dpxETH/eth curve pool.

if its not true hope the sponsor correct it 🙂


[08/28/2023 20:13] mangoeth
Well you get the bond nft first. And after the maturity time passes (5days default i think) you can call redeem() where the nft gets burned and your receive the receipt token. But its only a mock currently.

Do you happen to know if the put options created when bonding, if they are straight up sold to gmx leverage traders? Also if one were to be used up, would you stop earning rewards on each epoch??


[08/28/2023 20:17] 0k_sec
when we call bonds function we have a `boolean` which it decide if we need to create a put options or not, for other questions not sure but @psytama  may know the answer

Well i mean in the scenario the put option bool is on. The documentation on the vaults, stated that these options would be further sold to gmx leverage traders as a form of insurance for them not to get liquidated. So i was wondering if the options from this bonding from rdpxV2Core.sol were used for that,


[08/28/2023 20:23] mangoeth

Fyi, the receipt token represents dpxEth/Eth LP in a curve pool and not rDPX/eth. The dpxEth itself is backed by rDPX/eth LP along with the right to exercise the puts if eth/rDPX ratio drops

please do, if you as sponsor deem valuable such issues and agree with judges on it, we can provide them as auditors, if existing. Long term it will help the protocol.

Hello!
Who and where can mint `RdpxDecayingBonds`?  I Found only usage already created bonds


[08/29/2023 07:01] 0xsl1
that what the sponsor said 
so when bondId is 0 it means the user has to transfer rdpx but if it has a non 0 value then they want to use the id of decaying bondable rdpx NFT the only way a user receives this is if they face a loss using one of our other products then as a rebate a decaying bondable rdpx bond is minted for the user with a expiry after which it is no longer valid and a amount based on the loss.

cc @psytama can you clarify this


[08/29/2023 08:59] saint6704
I think purchase() in PerpetualAtlanticVault.sol does that


[08/29/2023 09:01] kawaicho
this is for purchasing the options


[08/29/2023 09:02] kawaicho
i could me wrong i don't know


[08/29/2023 09:05] 0xsl1
in rdpxV2Core _purchaseOptions is called, which in turn calls purchase in PerpetualAtlanticVault where the option is minted, so the buyer is rdpxV2Core, while the write is the vault itself. At least that's how i understood it


[08/29/2023 09:14] saint6704
so we give eth and get rdpx when we purchase options ?


[08/29/2023 09:14] saint6704
@sl1


[08/29/2023 09:15] 0xsl1
i am not at the pc rn, but as far as i remember, the option is on rdpx, so essentially it’s buying rdpx with eth at the predetermined strike price

```


[08/29/2023 12:46] 0k_sec
first we say the full amount of rdpx will be sent to the reserve and then we say we burn %50 rdpx in treasury reserve, how treasury reserve contains the rdpx if we send it all to the backing reserve ?


[08/29/2023 12:46] 0k_sec
```
- The full amount of rDPX and 33% of the ETH provided (33% of 75% = 25%) is sent to the [Backing Reserve](https://www.notion.so/rDPX-V2-RI-b45b5b402af54bcab758d62fb7c69cb4?pvs=21) and used to mint dpxETH which is then paired with the rest of the ETH to LP on curve.
- 50% of the rDPX provided for bonding is burnt from the [Treasury Reserve](https://www.notion.so/rDPX-V2-RI-b45b5b402af54bcab758d62fb7c69cb4?pvs=21) and another 50% is sent as emissions to veDPX holders. These percentages are variable and can be controlled by governance.

the last time we update the funds per a strick, in the `calculateFunding` we update this value as i know.


[08/29/2023 13:26] elderberrylind
Double check with psy but afaik the way it works is there is some amount of rDPX in the Dopex treasury right now (prior to any bonding occuring). When someone bonds, let's say $100 worth of value, $25 worth is rDPX. That bonded rDPX value is paired with $25 of bonded Eth and becomes LP for the rDPX/eth pool(backing reserve). Then, $25 worth of Treasury rDPX is taken from Treasury holdings and $12.5 dollars worth is burnt. And $12.5 worth of rDPX is given out to vedpx holders as rewards.

[08/29/2023 14:42] klau5_
I understood that Core is option caller(buyer) and users who deposit their tokens at perpVault are option writer(seller). 
But at the docs, `To mint a bond carrying approx. 1 Receipt Token you will deposit 25 rDPX (25%) & 0.75 ETH (75%) + the premium for the size of the rDPX provided for an rDPX Atlantic Perpetual PUT option which is 25% out of the money.` and at the `bond` function, bond caller's WETH is used for paying premium.
I thinks this means that user who call `bond` should pay the premium of the option. Do I understand right?


[08/29/2023 14:46] 0k_sec
users will pay the premium at the initial time only, when creating bond and then for each epoch the protocol will pay the premium, thats how i understand the workflow of the bonding mechaism

Not sure this is accurate. Option buyers are always users bonding, so users bonding will always be the one paying the premium. Can u confirm @psytama.

@psytama  what is `calculateFunding` for exactly?
As combined with `payFunding` effectively increasing  (with `_updateFundingRate`) `fundingRates` 2x on the premium and paying the LP vault 2x?


[08/30/2023 06:05] 0x3b
Or I got something wrong...


[08/30/2023 06:09] 0xpsytama
its used to calculate the funding amount for all the active options at the beginning of a epoch for the epoch duration and payFunding sends the amount from the core contract then its paid out through a drip system throughout the epoch.


[08/30/2023 06:11] 0x3b
so after an epoch has ended admins call `calculateFunding` then `payFunding` to send weth from core to vault and slowly drip it to LP vault?

if you use decaying bonds you don't have to send the rdpx from your balance as it will use the rdpx balance from the decaying bonds and this is the only way to use decaying bonds.

`1 Receipt Token you will deposit 25 rDPX (25%) & 0.75 ETH (75%) + the premium` then out of that 0.75E or 75% of the initial spend, 33% of the ETH (33% of the 0.75) or 0.25 is sent to the backing reserve. The `(33% of 75% = 25%)` relates to the initial spend of ETH.

Anyone knows why divinding the discount here:
```
rdpxRequired = ((RDPX_RATIO_PERCENTAGE - (bondDiscount / 2)) * _amount * DEFAULT_PRECISION)
                / (DEFAULT_PRECISION * rdpxPrice * 1e2);
```


[08/31/2023 17:52] 0k_sec
Imo the discount is applied for both rdpx and weth, for example discount is 0.3 and if we div 2 then we set 0.15 for rdpx and weth which in this way the sum of  discount is 0.3


[08/31/2023 17:54] 0k_sec
In another meaning the 0.3 should be the discount for the rdpx/weth together, that how i understand it @psytama  and @tztokchad  can correct it if I’m wrong

{Reactions}
👍 

[08/31/2023 18:16] mangoeth
The _amounts has to be an array here, because not everyones delegated weth balance will satisfy every amount. If a specific id has enough remaining weth to bond said amount, another id could possibly not satisfy the same amount. This way a user can bond many times using up many delegatees remaining weth, disregarding their active collateral.

{Reactions}
🙏🏻 👍🏻 

[08/31/2023 18:50] asui0944
in the bond function we can pass an argument rdpxBondId but this bondId is not the actual token id that is to be minted. And  if 0 is passed as the rdpxBondId it seems to have a discount
can someone explain this please?


[08/31/2023 18:55] 0k_sec
i don't get it what you mean by tokenID, but this is used for the decaying bond, if users have decay bond which they will get it only of they face a loss in the protocol projects, if the bondID is non zero then the user use this decay bond to pay the rdpx required.


[08/31/2023 18:56] 0k_sec
decay bond contain rdpx which the protocol mint it to users who face loss in one of the dopex projects

[09/01/2023 14:05] asui0944
where  can i find this receiptToken contract


[09/01/2023 14:05] 0k_sec
i think its refers to weth/dpxETH or by another meaning:


[09/01/2023 14:06] 0k_sec
the amount user will stake in the pool and the amount the core contracts using it mint dpxETH as  i know

For example, check out ReceiptTokenMock contract


[09/01/2023 14:12] asui0944
oh! so when _stake is called amount/2 is deducted from the reserves of weth and amount / 2 is dpxETH is mint so that weth and dpxEth amount is the same and both the tokens are deposited and the receiptTokenAmount is returned which represents the weth/dpxEth amount ?

[09/01/2023 15:31] asui0944
to my understanding when user redeem their bond they will get the receip token which is the token that represents the eth/dpxEth so yeah rdpx will not be returned to the user

[09/02/2023 10:13] 0xtendency
@tztokchad please check dm


[09/02/2023 10:18] parsely.
I have a question please, it's more about the tokenomics than the code.
My understanding is dpxETH is 1:1 with ETH.
Q1: How is the value of the dpxETH determined? 
I read the documents about the backing reserves.
Do the reserves guarantee that the price will remain 1:1? 
What if the price drops and we've called lowerDepeg and there are no more dpxEth to burn (or can they be minted via another way than upperDepeg function)? 

Q2: What incentive is there besides the fee for a user to `addDelegate`? My understanding (and tests) are that if nobody uses their eth, they just get their ETH back?
 What is the likelihood of that happening?

DISCLAIMER: This may have been discussed or it may display my lack of understanding of the code base, either way please forgive


[09/02/2023 11:14] tztokchad
1. Since dpxeth is minted against 50% of bonded value in eth that is provided by the bonders, it would always maintain peg unless someone takes up a significant cost by purchasing dpxeth from the curve pool (and facing slippage and getting arbed), dumping it en masse (again facing slippage and getting arbed)


[09/02/2023 11:15] tztokchad
Along with a reasonable A factor it becomes very hard to depeg dpxeth


[09/02/2023 11:16] tztokchad
2. If they delegate their eth, they get to take a % of the bonded value of receipt tokens based on the fee they charge from rdpx holders.


[09/02/2023 11:26] parsely.
Thank you very much for the responses, my understanding is it would happen this way if someone bonded with the delegate id, but if not, the depositor just receives their deposit back.
Is that a "risk" (not really a risk) they take, that no one will use their ETH and they just withdraw and get their money back (ie there is no gauarantee of any return for depositing unless its used)

@tztokchad in which scenario isReLPActive is set to true and trigger reLP function ?


[09/02/2023 12:12] superman_i4g
The perfect answer to this; 

1. If use_safe_approve is true, it uses a safe approval method called safeApprove from TransferHelper. This method is used for tokens like USDT and requires resetting the approval to zero before each new approval.

2. If use_safe_approve is false, it uses the standard approve method from the token contract (assumed to implement the ERC-20 standard) to approve the specified address to spend the specified amount of tokens.

[09/02/2023 12:14] parsely.
Please correct my understanding if it is incorrect, but just sharing here so it may be helpful to others
1. User A -> addTodelegate , (NOTE: they can withdraw the unused portion of their deposit at any time -> but they will never get back in the `withdraw` function all their ETH if any was used.)

2. any user -> `bondWithDelegate.` using delegate id  created by step `1`.

3. A new bond id (RdpxV2Bond) is minted to `User A `(and the user but POV is depositor in this scenario).

4. After maturity of bond User A can redeem the receiptTokens from the bond minted in step `3`

Step `3` takes into account the `fee` so the amount of tokens added include the fee portion no need claim it later.

Sure: When a user calls `bondWithdelegate` 
The flow is:
`bondWithdelegate`->`_bondWithDelegate` ->which calls `_calculateAmounts` as part of its flow. this sends in the `fee` of the delegate.

`_calculateAmounts` returns 2 values both of which are used to create bonds, one  for the user and one for the depositor.

These return values take into account the fee that is set by the depositor:
```
// account for delegate fee
    amount1 = (amount1 * (100e8 - _delegateFee)) / 1e10;

    amount2 = _amount - amount1;
```
So when the bond is created the fee is already taken into account

[09/03/2023 09:33] 0xnirlin
At the start of every epoch, admin first calls the calculateFunding() and than provideFunding() to pay the required premium amounts for the epoch from core. And than this funding is slowly dripped during the epoch along with the new premiums.

[09/04/2023 08:49] asui0944
When calculating rdpxRequired are we dividing it by the rdpx amount in weth so that the values are both in weth 
Example. 5 is the amount of  rdpx required before calculating the value in weth and the rdpxAmountInEth is 0.2 then 5/0.2 is 25 hence the rdpxRequired will be 25


[09/04/2023 08:55] asui0944
I was confused cuz the mock oracle rdpx to eth returns 5e8 so when dividing by precision (1e8) we get 5 which doesn't make sense this means rdpx is greater than weth
If my understanding is correct the real oracle will return value less than 5e8 right? So that when we divide by precision the rdpxAmountInEth become something like 0.05

Your above mentioned check, checks if the token at the 0 index is weth, if it is, it sets a to be index 0 and b index 1, else, sets a as index 1 and b as index 0.
The goal is to keep a to point to weth and b to be any other token, like rdpx

when purchasing options why is there a timeToExpiry


[09/05/2023 12:30] 0xffchainx
That is generally in the nature of options, an option to buy or sell has to expire


[09/05/2023 12:38] asui0944
but i dont see it being used 
its used to calculate the premium but not used when the option is minted 
or did i get it wrong


[09/05/2023 13:04] 0k_sec
the `timeToExpiry` is used for the calculating as options did not have expire time but they can be exercised when its ITM.


[09/05/2023 13:08] asui0944
Ok so option doesn't have a time to expire but 
What can timeToExpire impact does it impact the only the premium calculation

i think yes, the put option will be exercised when its at ITM.


[09/05/2023 13:11] asui0944

@KmanOfficial under the home directory of depex at Github, there is a link to the openZeppelin's code, download the code as a zipfile and unzip it to the lib directory of dopex.


[09/05/2023 17:54] chaduke3730
In this way, we make sure we use the right versio of openZeppelin, newer version might not work sometimes

if we are able to scan the whole directory after compiling it with forge and get a visual of all vulnerabilities.. whats the use of doing slither analysis on individual solidity contracts when you already have all vulnerabilities lised from doing slither . on the whole directory and just list them on the report.. am i getting something wrong?

[09/05/2023 21:29] chris0xff
nothing gives you a visual of all vulnerabilities. some of the features on forge are newer than the lifetime of slither. results have to be rep[roducible so why would i trust the dev team's run of slither. also there are different settings


[09/05/2023 21:30] chris0xff
the point of having the shared automated scans is just so everyone has a common picture of the situation with the basic tools to start iwht

[09/06/2023 11:50] dev0cloo
You use the GitHub repo of the project. For any code you want to reference, you go to where it is in the repo, click the line the referenced code starts at and copy the url in your browser. It would look something like this "https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/amo/UniV2LiquidityAmo.sol#L109"

If the referenced code spans multiple lines, you just look for the line it ends at and modify the url to include those by adding "-L<line number code ends at>" to the end of the GitHub url. So the above example would be "https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/amo/UniV2LiquidityAmo.sol#L109-L112" for some code that spans 4 lines

Hi fren,

It's not appropriate to criticize the sponsor/devs/code in this way.

Getting an audit is already nerve-wracking for any protocol and any dev that's willing to put their code into the arena for us to tear apart deserves to be respected.

[10/20/2023 09:00] chris0xff
My comment was crude and unprofessional in tone but this was meant to provide some levity to a serious situation. That code was not ready to be audited.  The devs should be given the same leniency that you would give a construction company if they built an apartment building that would fall down at half of its specified load rating. There is more at stake than feelings here. It is more than nerve-wracking to deal with the adversaries that exist in the wild, it is deadly. and they are more numerous, better skilled, and better funded than any type of auditors. If someone sees you responsible for losing millions of dollars of their money, they will be ready to hurt more than your feelings.

{Reactions}
👀 (2) wtf 

[10/20/2023 12:01] lourenslinde
imho it comes down to the fact that we are here to help any protocol/team secure their project. 

Yes, we do operate in an adversarial space. 

But we don't want the way we conduct ourselves to become a barrier to projects seeking C4's services. Acting unprofessionally only serves to deter teams from approaching us and ultimately harms our industry. 

Code quality is a subjective measure and we should assume positive intent from any team approaching C4. Have comments about code quality or think a codebase needs more extensive testing? Add it to your analysis; do it well enough and you will get paid for it. 

Once the contest is over we leave it all in the arena.

{Reactions}
👍 (7) thankyou 

[10/20/2023 12:50] chris0xff
I dont agree that code quality is subjective or that such a sentiment is compatible with the premise needed to see a security audit as a thing of value. Codebase is not ready for an audit when problems are so pervasive that fixing one will create and destroy many others. That codebase needed something else. If it were my decision i would have turned them around and refunded them and asked them to use the funding to pursue whatever that something else is


[10/20/2023 12:51] chris0xff
that is what i meant by my comment initially. but i didnt think i needed to spell it out so carefully


[10/20/2023 12:52] 0xtendency
I don't think you know what you are saying, those who audited this codebase knows that it was tough, but just like every other contest issues were found.

You don't have the right to bring this up here, this should be your mere thoughts and yours alone

sorry man its a matter of professional integrity. even my first comment was an attempt at a censored and temperate approach to expressing my overall reaction to the codebase.

[10/27/2023 15:34] lsaudit
isn't the escalation - a period when warden can escalate the issue? When escalation-period ends, judges still need some time to resolve those escalations? I thought it works that way.


[10/27/2023 15:34] lsaudit
So rn noone can escalate more issues, but the ones which had been escalated - still need to be resolved?

You are right: when escalations are marked as ended on the Daily Warden, it means the allocated time to raise issues has closed. Thereafter only the escalated issues are dealt with.

Congrats to all watsons :10_10: . I reviewed alot of the backstage findings, and I can say c4 wardens are just impressive. Lots to learn!

Also, thanks for the kind words @nirlin @0xrex , I am itching to go back to auditing, I haven't audited in 3 weeks 😢


[10/31/2023 19:28] jvorex
C4 wardens are elites fosho! @0xnev should balance it. Always a pleasure reading your findings. Killing at at judging killing it at auditing gg!

[10/31/2023 20:23] mike_bello90
oo man! I cannot get bugs in any audit! have to retire for some months to study more and get back later to see if I can get a valid finding 🥲


[10/31/2023 20:28] ayo#6131

[10/31/2023 20:41] petrichor0961

Hi @PaperParachute | C4 
My name is in results list but i wasn't tagged, is there a reason ?
I got $208.46


[10/31/2023 21:35] _paperparachute
Our awards had you listed as the username displayed (Aymen0909)?


[10/31/2023 21:37] codecipher9
yeah I know but I mean why wasn't tagged with discord username  like other wardens, just asking?


[10/31/2023 21:40] _paperparachute
I'm no longer at my PC this evening but I'll look into it. When I tried to @ aymen0909 it didn't give me any options.


[10/31/2023 23:44] lsaudit
@Mike_Bello  have you participate in any contest which have the report already published? I'd like to take a look at what you've reported


[11/01/2023 04:01] 0xnirlin

[11/01/2023 04:18] mike_bello90
yes I have participated like in 12 contests :D,  good entry  is one that has published the report


[11/01/2023 04:25] mike_bello90
I can see in my profile now, that here in dopex I get 1 high validate (1 out of 8), but only pays me 0.01 🥲


[11/01/2023 05:26] yashar0x
It was my first contest, I won $0.15 🤌
1 valid high bug with more than 1e18 duplicates 😏

Yes coming back soon!! :chefskiss:


[11/01/2023 09:56] lourenslinde
This was a tough one, there were so many duplicates of some high issues that rewards got duplicated away. 

On the bright side, you can get backstage access with your confirmed high. That's going to be worth more than 1 cent!
